# Level 4: Agentic Workflows

At Level 4, you move from **reactive assistance** to **proactive automation**. Instead of asking your AI for help with each task, you deploy autonomous agents that monitor, reason, and act based on objectives you define.

**The key difference from Level 3:** Agents operate autonomously rather than waiting for your prompts. They detect events, make decisions within guardrails, and coordinate with each other through shared memory (your LOCK-structured hunts).

---

## What Changes at Level 4

### Level 3 vs. Level 4

**Level 3 (Interactive):**

- You: "Execute hunt H-0042"
- Claude: [Runs query, creates ticket, updates hunt]
- **Pattern:** You direct every action

**Level 4 (Autonomous):**

- Agent: [Monitors CTI feed every 6 hours]
- Agent: [Detects new Qakbot campaign, searches past hunts]
- Agent: [Generates draft hunt H-0156.md, flags for review]
- Agent: [Posts to Slack: "New hunt ready for review"]
- **Pattern:** Agent acts on objectives, you validate

### Success at Level 4

- Agents **monitor** CTI feeds without your intervention
- Agents **generate** draft hunts based on new threats
- Agents **coordinate** through shared LOCK memory
- You **validate and approve** rather than create from scratch

---

## Multi-Agent Architecture

At Level 4, multiple specialized agents work together, coordinating through your LOCK-structured hunt repository.

### Example Agent Roles

#### CTI Monitor Agent

**Role:** Watch threat feeds and identify relevant TTPs

**Triggers:**

- Scheduled: Every 6 hours
- Webhook: New threat intel published

**Actions:**

1. Query CTI feeds (MISP, AlienVault OTX, vendor feeds)
2. Extract MITRE ATT&CK techniques
3. Search past hunts: "Have we covered this technique?"
4. If new technique → trigger Hypothesis Generator Agent

#### Hypothesis Generator Agent

**Role:** Create draft hunt files in LOCK format

**Triggers:**

- Agent event from CTI Monitor: "New technique detected"

**Actions:**

1. Search past hunts for related TTPs
2. Review lessons learned from similar hunts
3. Generate LOCK-formatted hypothesis
4. Validate query syntax
5. Create draft hunt file (hunts/H-XXXX.md)
6. Trigger Validator Agent

#### Validator Agent

**Role:** Review draft hunts for feasibility

**Triggers:**

- Agent event from Hypothesis Generator: "Draft ready"

**Actions:**

1. Check query against data sources (from AGENTS.md)
2. Validate MITRE technique IDs
3. Verify data source availability
4. Flag issues or approve for review
5. Trigger Notifier Agent

#### Notifier Agent

**Role:** Alert analysts when human review is needed

**Triggers:**

- Agent event from Validator: "Review needed"

**Actions:**

1. Post to Slack (#threat-hunting channel)
2. Create GitHub issue with label "hunt-review"
3. Send email summary to security team
4. Update hunt tracking dashboard

#### Baseline Profiling Agent

**Role:** Establish behavioral norms and flag statistical deviations (PEAK: Baseline hunt type)

Unlike the CTI Monitor, this agent does not depend on external threat intelligence. It generates hunts from **internal environmental change** — deviations from what your own telemetry says is normal.

**Triggers:**

- Scheduled: Daily or weekly per scope (host role, account type, subnet)
- Configuration: New baseline scope added by analyst

**Actions:**

1. Query telemetry to profile normal behavior for a defined scope (e.g., process execution frequency by host role, service account login patterns, DNS query volume by subnet)
2. Store versioned baselines as artifacts (e.g., `baselines/B-XXXX.json`)
3. Compare current observations against the most recent baseline for the same scope
4. If deviation exceeds configured threshold → generate draft investigation (I-XXXX) with deviation details
5. If deviation is severe or recurring → escalate to Hypothesis Generator Agent for a formal hunt
6. Trigger Notifier Agent for significant anomalies

**Guardrails:**

- Baselines must have a minimum sample period (e.g., 14 days) before deviations are flagged
- Deviation thresholds are configurable per scope to avoid noise
- Seasonal and known-maintenance windows are excluded from comparison

#### Adversary Simulation Validation Agent

**Role:** Track whether hunts and detections have been validated against known-good attack simulations

A successful hunt hypothesis that has never been tested against a controlled simulation is an assumption, not a validated detection. This agent closes that gap by mapping hunts to test cases and tracking validation coverage.

**Triggers:**

- Event: Hunt status changes to `completed` with true positives
- Event: New detection rule created from a hunt
- Scheduled: Monthly validation sweep

**Actions:**

1. Map existing hunts and derived detection rules to atomic tests (Atomic Red Team test IDs, MITRE Caldera campaigns)
2. Track which hunts have been validated by purple team exercises vs. untested
3. Score validation coverage per MITRE technique (validated / total hunts)
4. Flag high-priority hunts with no simulation coverage
5. Propose validation exercises for untested hunts, prioritized by technique severity and detection age
6. Trigger Notifier Agent with a validation gaps report

**Guardrails:**

- Never executes simulations autonomously — proposes exercises for human scheduling
- Validation mappings require analyst confirmation before being marked as "covered"
- Prioritization weights are configurable (technique severity, hunt age, business impact)

---

## Example Multi-Agent Workflows

### Scenario A: New Qakbot Campaign Detected

**1. CTI Monitor Agent (Autonomous - 06:00 UTC)**

```
[Agent runs scheduled job]
- Queries MISP feed for new indicators
- Detects: Qakbot campaign using T1059.003 (Windows Command Shell)
- Searches past hunts: grep "T1059.003" hunts/*.md
- Result: No prior coverage of this sub-technique
- Decision: New threat detected, trigger Hypothesis Generator
```

**2. Hypothesis Generator Agent (06:02 UTC)**

```
[Triggered by CTI Monitor]
- Reviews similar hunts: H-0042 (PowerShell), H-0089 (Process Execution)
- Extracts lessons: "Include parent-child process chains", "Filter System32 parents"
- Generates LOCK hypothesis:

  Learn: Qakbot campaign using T1059.003 detected in CTI
  Observe: Adversaries spawn cmd.exe from suspicious parents (Office, browsers)
  Check: [Generated Splunk query with bounds and limits]
  Keep: [Placeholder for execution results]

- Creates: hunts/H-0156.md
- Validates query syntax
- Decision: Draft ready, trigger Validator
```

**3. Validator Agent (06:03 UTC)**

```
[Triggered by Hypothesis Generator]
- Reads AGENTS.md for data source availability
- Checks: index=sysmon exists ✓
- Checks: EventCode=1 available ✓
- Validates: MITRE technique T1059.003 format ✓
- Reviews: Query has time bounds ✓
- Reviews: Query has result limits ✓
- Decision: Hunt validated, trigger Notifier
```

**4. Notifier Agent (06:04 UTC)**

```
[Triggered by Validator]
- Posts to Slack #threat-hunting:
  "🔍 New hunt H-0156 ready for review
  - Technique: T1059.003 (Windows Command Shell)
  - Threat: Qakbot campaign
  - Status: Draft generated, validation passed
  - Review: https://github.com/org/hunts/pull/156"

- Creates GitHub issue #156:
  Title: "Review hunt H-0156: Qakbot T1059.003 detection"
  Labels: hunt-review, auto-generated
  Assigned: @security-team

- Decision: Notification sent, workflow complete
```

**5. You Wake Up (08:30 UTC)**

```
Slack notification: "3 new draft hunts created overnight"

You review H-0156.md:
- Learn section: Clear threat context ✓
- Observe section: Specific hypothesis ✓
- Check section: Well-bounded query ✓
- Data sources: Available in our environment ✓

Decision: Approve and execute

You: "Execute hunt H-0156"
Claude: [Runs via Splunk MCP, finds 2 suspicious events, creates tickets]
```

**Result:** From threat detection to actionable investigation in under 3 hours, most of it automated.

### Scenario B: Service Account Baseline Deviation

This scenario demonstrates a hunt that originates **without any external threat intelligence** — purely from internal behavioral change.

**1. Baseline Profiling Agent (Autonomous - 02:00 UTC, weekly schedule)**

```
[Agent runs scheduled baseline job for scope: "service accounts"]
- Queries authentication logs for past 7 days
- Profiles: login count, unique destination hosts, login hours, auth protocols per service account
- Compares against stored baseline (B-0034.json, established over 30-day sample)
- Detects: svc_deploy logged into 14 unique hosts (baseline: 3 ± 1)
- Detects: svc_deploy active at 03:12 UTC (baseline hours: 09:00-17:00 UTC)
- Deviation score: 4.2 standard deviations above norm
- Decision: Severe deviation, trigger Hypothesis Generator + Notifier
```

**2. Hypothesis Generator Agent (02:01 UTC)**

```
[Triggered by Baseline Profiling Agent]
- Receives deviation context: svc_deploy, 14 hosts, off-hours
- Searches past hunts: finds H-0031 (lateral movement via service accounts)
- Extracts lessons: "Service accounts on >5 unique hosts in 24h warrants investigation"
- Generates LOCK hypothesis:

  Learn: Baseline deviation detected — svc_deploy accessed 14 hosts (norm: 3)
         during off-hours. Consistent with credential compromise or lateral movement.
  Observe: Compromised service accounts may authenticate to atypical hosts
           outside normal operating windows.
  Check: [Generated query scoped to svc_deploy, last 7 days, auth logs]
  Keep: [Placeholder for execution results]

- Creates: hunts/H-0201.md
- Decision: Draft ready, trigger Validator
```

**3. Validator Agent (02:02 UTC)**

```
[Triggered by Hypothesis Generator]
- Reads AGENTS.md for data source availability
- Checks: Authentication logs available ✓
- Checks: Service account inventory accessible ✓
- Validates: Query has time bounds (7 days) ✓
- Validates: Query has LIMIT clause ✓
- Cross-references: svc_deploy is not in known maintenance window ✓
- Decision: Hunt validated, trigger Notifier
```

**4. Notifier Agent (02:03 UTC)**

```
[Triggered by Validator]
- Posts to Slack #threat-hunting:
  "⚠️ Baseline deviation: svc_deploy on 14 hosts (norm: 3), off-hours activity
  - Draft hunt H-0201 ready for review
  - Deviation score: 4.2σ
  - No matching CTI — triggered by internal baseline"

- Creates GitHub issue #201:
  Title: "Review hunt H-0201: svc_deploy baseline deviation"
  Labels: hunt-review, baseline-deviation, auto-generated
```

**5. You Review (08:00 UTC)**

```
- H-0201 was generated without any threat intel feed — purely from behavioral data
- Deviation is significant and not explained by maintenance windows
- Approve and execute hunt
- Result: svc_deploy credentials were used from an unauthorized jump box
  following a phishing compromise of the deploy team lead
```

**Result:** Detected credential compromise that no CTI feed would have surfaced. The hunt originated entirely from internal behavioral deviation.

## Implementation Options

Level 4 can be built using various agent frameworks. Choose based on your team's experience and requirements.

### LangGraph

**Best for:** Stateful, multi-step workflows

**Strengths:**

- Built on LangChain ecosystem
- Graph-based workflow definition
- State management between steps
- Good for complex orchestration

**Example use case:** Multi-agent pipeline with conditional branching based on validation results

### CrewAI

**Best for:** Role-based agent collaboration

**Strengths:**

- Define agents by role (researcher, analyst, writer)
- Natural delegation between agents
- Built-in task management
- Good for team-based patterns

**Example use case:** CTI researcher agent + hypothesis writer agent + validator agent working together

### AutoGen

**Best for:** Conversational agent patterns

**Strengths:**

- Microsoft-backed framework
- Multi-agent conversations
- Human-in-the-loop patterns
- Good for collaborative workflows

**Example use case:** Agents discussing and refining hunts through conversation before presenting to humans

### Custom Orchestration

**Best for:** Purpose-built solutions

**Strengths:**

- Full control over architecture
- Integrate exactly your tools
- No framework overhead
- Optimized for your environment

**Example use case:** Simple Python scripts with cron triggers and API calls to your specific stack

---

## Guardrails and Safety

At Level 4, guardrails are critical. Agents operate autonomously, so you must define boundaries.

### Essential Guardrails

**1. Human Approval Required**

```yaml
guardrails:
  - all_hunts_require_human_approval: true
  - no_automatic_query_execution: true
```

Agents can draft hunts, but humans must approve before execution.

**2. Logging Everything**

```yaml
guardrails:
  - log_all_agent_actions: true
  - audit_trail: true
```

Every agent action must be logged for review.

**3. Rate Limiting**

```yaml
guardrails:
  - max_drafts_per_day: 10
  - max_notifications_per_day: 20
```

Prevent runaway agents from flooding your team.

**4. Validation Gates**

```yaml
guardrails:
  - require_data_source_validation: true
  - require_time_bounds_in_queries: true
```

Agents must validate hunts against your environment before flagging for review.

**5. Halt on Error**

```yaml
guardrails:
  - halt_on_error: true
  - notify_on_failure: true
```

If an agent encounters an error, stop the workflow and alert humans.

## Getting Started with Level 4

### Phase 1: Planning (Week 1)

1. **Define objectives:** What should agents do autonomously?
2. **Identify workflows:** Which manual tasks are repetitive?
3. **Choose framework:** LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, or custom?
4. **Design guardrails:** What are your safety boundaries?

### Phase 2: Single Agent (Weeks 2-4)

1. **Start simple:** Deploy one monitoring agent (CTI monitor)
2. **Test in sandbox:** Run agent in isolated environment
3. **Validate outputs:** Review agent-generated drafts
4. **Tune parameters:** Adjust triggers and thresholds

### Phase 3: Multi-Agent (Weeks 5-8)

1. **Add second agent:** Hypothesis generator
2. **Test coordination:** Verify agents communicate correctly
3. **Add third agent:** Validator
4. **Complete pipeline:** CTI Monitor → Generator → Validator → Notifier

### Phase 4: Production (Weeks 9-12)

1. **Deploy to production:** Run agents on real CTI feeds
2. **Monitor closely:** Review all agent actions daily
3. **Iterate on guardrails:** Adjust based on false positives
4. **Measure impact:** Track time saved and hunt quality

---

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure Level 4 success:

**Automation Metrics:**

- **Draft hunts generated per week** (target: 3-5)
- **Time from threat detection to hunt draft** (target: <1 hour)
- **Human review time per draft** (target: <10 minutes)

**Quality Metrics:**

- **Draft approval rate** (target: >80%)
- **Query validation success rate** (target: >95%)
- **False positive rate in agent-generated hunts** (target: <20%)

**Impact Metrics:**

- **Total time saved per week** (target: 5-10 hours)
- **Hunts executed per month** (increase over Level 3 baseline)
- **Mean time to detect new threats** (decrease over manual process)

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: CTI-Driven Hunt Generation

**Flow:** CTI Feed → Technique Extraction → Hunt Generation → Human Review

**Agents:** CTI Monitor + Hypothesis Generator + Validator + Notifier

### Pattern 2: Alert-Driven Investigation

**Flow:** SIEM Alert → Historical Search → Draft Response → Ticket Creation

**Agents:** Alert Monitor + Context Researcher + Response Generator + Ticket Creator

### Pattern 3: Scheduled Hunt Refresh

**Flow:** Daily Schedule → Review Old Hunts → Re-execute Queries → Update Results

**Agents:** Scheduler + Hunt Executor + Results Analyzer + Documentation Updater

### Pattern 4: Baseline Deviation Hunting

**Flow:** Scheduled Profiling → Baseline Storage → Deviation Detection → Draft Investigation or Hunt

**Agents:** Baseline Profiler + Hypothesis Generator + Validator + Notifier

**Key difference from Patterns 1-3:** No external trigger required. Hunts originate from internal behavioral change — deviations in authentication patterns, process execution frequency, network traffic volumes, or other telemetry norms. This addresses the PEAK "Baseline" hunt type, which is absent from CTI-driven pipelines.

### Pattern 5: Hunt Validation via Adversary Simulation

**Flow:** Hunt/Detection Inventory → Simulation Mapping → Coverage Gap Analysis → Validation Proposal

**Agents:** Adversary Simulation Validator + Notifier

**Key difference from Patterns 1-4:** This pattern does not produce hunts. It validates them. It answers: "Of all the hunts we've completed and detections we've deployed, which ones have actually been tested against a controlled simulation?" Untested hunts are assumptions; validated hunts are detections.

## Remember

**Success can look like many things at Level 4.** You might have agents that autonomously execute queries using MCP servers, or agents that orchestrate multi-step workflows. At this stage, you're mature enough to make architectural decisions based on your team's needs and risk tolerance.

**The key:** All agents share the same memory layer - your LOCK-structured hunts - ensuring consistency and enabling true coordination.
